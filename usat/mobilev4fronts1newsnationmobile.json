Neighbors reported last seeing Henry between August 2015 and early 2016, but Edward insisted he lived with his father until August 2016. He told deputies his father had moved in with his girlfriend.

"TUSAYAN, Ariz. \u2014 A wet winter and increased groundwater flow have raised water levels at Canyon uranium mine near the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, stirring concerns among conservationists who fear that the spread of uranium mines could contaminate water across the plateau.Water levels at Canyon mine were so high at one point in March that the mine's operator had to spray water into the air to enhance evaporation and increase the amount of water it was hauling to its White Mesa uranium mill in Utah.Arizona state regulators say they have not found any violations at the mine site, and the mine's operators say water levels have begun to drop.", "contentProtectionState": "free", "assets": [{"orientation": "vertical", "contentSourceCode": "unknown", "height":

are seeking permission to do research in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.On Nov. 28, severe drought and high-speed winds sent a 5-day-old, 1.5-acre fire racing from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park toward Gatlinburg and surrounding Sevier County, Tenn., communities. More than 11,000 park acres were burned. Authorities failed to evacuate residents, and the firestorm ultimately killed 14 people, injured hundreds more, and destroyed 2,400 structures.\"As word of the fire was spreading, we were contacted by about 75 different people. They represent more than 30 research institutions,\" said Paul Super, the park's research coordinator. \"The vast majority were people who have done research in the park, some for a long time. Many were people who thought they might have had study plots that were within the area of burns.

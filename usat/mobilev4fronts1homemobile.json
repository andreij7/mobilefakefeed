the pictures of the victims of the chemical attack and said his attitude toward the Assad regime \"has changed very much. ... What happened yesterday is unacceptable to me.\"The latest attack, Trump said, \"crossed a lot of lines for me.\"Radar showed that Syrian warplanes were in the vicinity of the suspected chemical-weapons attack, according to a senior Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence matters.", "contentProtectionState": "free", "assets": [{"orientation": "vertical", "contentSourceCode": "unknown", "height": "3630", "id": 100087324, "adsEnabled": true, "author": "Uncredited, AP", "ssts": null, "shortUrl": "", "cst": "news", "type": "image", "status": "published", "canonicalUrl": "", "tags": [], "siteId": 1, "caption": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad", "siteCode": "USAT", "contentProtectionState": null, "url": "", "imageUrl": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg", "title": "AP MIDEAST SYRIA I SYR", "crops": {"3_4": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7dd76021025b42a6aa7bff98e4be1dbea5c1a7f6/c=139-0-2862-3630/local/-/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg", "16_9": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e68ac0ae9f00d2430ad542d3a985ff52a5c1229/c=0-379-2999-2074/local/-/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg", "front_thumb": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e37b2a30f9d1feae7a6c84bb9e5fe31551c321e4/c=0-533-3000-3097/local/-/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg", "9_16": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7bab4460ff31831d372cf13ac27704cf63e2bc34/c=484-0-2517-3630/local/-/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg", "1_1": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d27bb232fe499b012992d901a54a0258c92d564f/c=0-315-3000-3315/local/-/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg", "4_3": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4eeaf492918edcdfa8b33467b38b4a564e0f110c/c=0-267-2999-2522/local/-/media/2017/04/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636270036596798491-AP-Mideast-Syria-003.jpg"}, "cutline": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad", "width": "3000"}, {"contentUrl": "https://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201704/3539/29906170001_5386434900001_5386424479001.mp4", "contentSourceCode": "APDM", "brightcoveAccount": "29906170001", "duration": "00:47", "thumbnailAsset": 100079718, "keywords": "Donald Trump", "iosContentUrl": "http://c.brightcove.com/services/mobile/streaming/index/master.m3u8?videoId=5386424479001", "id": 100079718, "adsEnabled": true, "iosRenditions": [{"contentUrl": "rtmp://cp17277.edgefcs.net/ondemand/&mp4:Brightcove/Brightcove2/29906170001/201704/3539/29906170001_5386434887001_5386424479001.mp4", "bitrate": 1803000, "audioOnly": false}, {"contentUrl": "rtmp://cp17277.edgefcs.net/ondemand/&mp4:Brightcove/Brightcove2/29906170001/201704/3539/29906170001_5386434900001_5386424479001.mp4", "bitrate": 214000, "audioOnly": false}], "author": "AP, AP", "ssts": {"topic": null, "taxonomyEntityDisplayName": null, "section": "news", "subsection": "nation", "subtopic": null}, "description": "President Donald Trump condemns chemical attack in Syria as an 'affront to humanity' that 'cannot be tolerated.'

VISTA, Calif. \u2014 When I watched YouTube execs unveil the new YouTube TV service at a flashy press conference here a few weeks ago, I was skeptical.How were young people, the folks who don\u2019t pay for cable, going to be convinced to fork over $35 monthly to watch network TV, some cable and sports on YouTube?Furthermore, for the ones who might be interested, would they put up with the absence of youth-oriented cable channels like MTV, Comedy Central and Adult Swim?I still think YouTube has a major challenge ahead. But after a short test drive of YouTube TV, which launches today in select cities, I\u2019m also quite impressed.The service, which features shows from the major TV broadcast networks and select cable offerings, looks fabulous on the phone, which is where I saw it previewed, more like Netflix than Comcast, which is a good thing. (YouTube TV is also available for viewing on tablets and desktop computers, and on TVs via the $35 Google Chromecast dongle.)", "contentProtectionState": "free", "assets": [{"contentUrl":

lure of more mega-dollars flowing from the TV booth. And after spending most of the last two seasons wrapped in physical rehab, who could blame him for deciding to hang it up after 14 pro seasons?Just don\u2019t say that he\u2019s fully going out on his own terms. In the end, his body told him it was time.Knowing the type of competitor that Romo is, I doubt that this is how he really wanted to retire \u2014 with his last pass (albeit a 3-yard TD strike to Terrance Williams that capped an 81-yard drive) coming in a cameo relief appearance in a meaningless Week 17 game.", "contentProtectionState": "free", "assets": [{"status": "published", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2017/04/04/a-look-back-at-tony-romo-career-highlights-memorable-moments-dallas-cowboys/100021510/", "source": null, "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.usatoday.com", "description": "QB had plenty of highlights and lowlights in his 14 years with the Cowboys.", "title": "Memorable moments of Tony Romo's 14 years with the Dallas Cowboys", "assetId": 100021510, "thumbnail_width": 300, "html": "<style>\n    .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }\n    .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }\n    p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; }\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"oembed-asset oembed-asset-link oembed-asset-usa-today oembed-simple-link-container\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2017/04/04/a-look-back-at-tony-romo-career-highlights-memorable-moments-dallas-cowboys/100021510/\" data-track-label=\"newrecircinline\" class=\"oembed-simple-link oembed-link-anchor\">\n        <p class=\"oembed-link-desc\">Memorable moments of Tony Romo&#39;s 14 years with the Dallas Cowboys</p>\n        <div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n    </a>\n</div>", "original_type": "link", "version": "1.0", "thumbnail_height": 300, "cache_age": 10800, "thumbnail_url": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bce17c28648e633ea285ea451241107b33f724da/r=300/https/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df225a0f1fd41a6d54fcacaa2fe70a430b3c572e/c=124-309-1296-1481/local/-/media/2017/04/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636269026323680737-C03-ROMO3-30.jpg", "provider_name": "USA TODAY"}, "type": "oembed", "id": 100031810}, {"status": "published", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/04/04/cowboys-tony-romo-broadcasting/100014406/", "source": null, "oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.usatoday.com", "description": "The former Cowboys quarterback had inquiries from CBS, Fox.", "title": "Cowboys' Tony Romo retiring from NFL for broadcast gig with CBS", "assetId": 100014406, "thumbnail_width": 300, "html": "<style>\n    .oembed-asset-link { border-bottom: 1px solid #e1e1e1; }\n    .oembed-link-anchor { display: block; clear: both; }\n    p.oembed-link-desc { font-size: 100%; color: #666; font-weight: normal; margin: 0 14px 14px 14px; font-family: 'Futura Today Light'; text-align: left; line-height: 120%; }\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"oembed-asset oembed-asset-link oembed-asset-usa-today oembed-simple-link-container\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/04/04/cowboys-tony-romo-broadcasting/100014406/\" data-track-label=\"newrecircinline\" class=\"oembed-simple-link oembed-link-anchor\">\n        <p class=\"oembed-link-desc\">Cowboys&#39; Tony Romo retiring from NFL for broadcast gig with CBS</p>\n        <div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n    </a>\n</div>", "original_type": "link", "version": "1.0", "thumbnail_height": 300, "cache_age": 10800, "thumbnail_url": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bce17c28648e633ea285ea451241107b33f724da/r=300/https/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffbc7e87d8d49bc105c51b10e679f10945c9d0d9/c=669-0-3546-2877/local/-/media/2017/04/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636268887928895651-USATSI-9781846.jpg", "provider_name": "USA TODAY"}, "type": "oembed", "id": 100031792}, {"status": "published", "url": "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/04/tony-romo-retirement-broadcasting-dallas-cowboys-underrated-playoffs-botched-snap-field-goal-dez-bryant-catch-packers-video", "source": null, "oembed": {"provider_url": "http://ftw.usatoday.com", "original_type": "link", "description": "When you think of Tony Romo, what's the first thing that immediately comes to mind?

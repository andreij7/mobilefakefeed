stateside, The Journal News/lohud has found.Many of the tax havens traced back to the Panama Papers, a global news consortium\u2019s report that used leaked legal documents to expose how corporate executives and political leaders stashed billions of dollars in Central American banks.The Panama Papers ignited probes of high-ranking politicians and powerful companies, and shined a light on the dark world of international finance, prompting resignations that shocked entire nations.And now, while these latest revelations about the New York hospitals are legal, the foreign investments further

municipalities and school districts lost out on at least $1 billion in revenue last year because private, nonprofit educational organizations don't have to pay property taxes.That's according to a USA Today Network analysis of state Department of Taxation and Finance data, which showed that $36.5 billion worth of property owned by private nonprofit educational organizations was exempt from paying property taxes in 2015. Another $10 billion worth of property, also tax-exempt, belongs to the state university system.Property taxes are the largest single source of revenue for local governments in New York. And across the state, the value of exempt private educational property is increasing. The exemptions can put an added strain on municipalities struggling to balance budgets within the state's property-tax cap, even while they supply the schools with police, fire and other services.", "contentProtectionState": "metered", "assets": [{"contentUrl": "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/roc-mobile/201610/3484/36517057001_5177389521001_5177381918001.mp4", "contentSourceCode": "PROC", "brightcoveAccount": "36517057001", "duration": "00:37", "thumbnailAsset": 92479732, "keywords": "Taxes", "iosContentUrl": "http://c.brightcove.com/services/mobile/streaming/index/master.m3u8?videoId=5177381918001", "id": 92479732, "adsEnabled": true, "iosRenditions": [{"contentUrl": "rtmp://cp81316.edgefcs.net/ondemand/&mp4:brightcove/36517057001/201610/3484/36517057001_5177389360001_5177381918001.mp4", "bitrate": 1801000, "audioOnly": false}, {"contentUrl": "rtmp://cp81316.edgefcs.net/ondemand/&mp4:brightcove/36517057001/201610/3484/36517057001_5177389521001_5177381918001.mp4", "bitrate": 522000, "audioOnly": false}], "author": "Olivia Lopez", "ssts": {"topic": "", "taxonomyEntityDisplayName": null, "section": "news", "subsection": "", "subtopic": ""}, "shortUrl": "http://on.rocne.ws/2eKTFpI", "cst": "news", "brightcoveId": "5177381918001", "type": "video", "dateModified": "2016-10-26T10:43:18Z", "status": "published", "description": "Private colleges, if taxed, would have generated $1 billion last year.", "tags": [{"taggingStatus": "UserTagged", "topicType": "Automated", "name": "Taxes", "relevanceScore": 0, "dateTagged": "2016-10-20T17:32:28.593", "parentId": "7cc8a958-4359-40c3-b87f-97b131fb4941", "path": "GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS/Government business and finance/Government revenue/Taxes", "isPrimary": true, "type": "Subjects", "id": "a408540b-7c82-4892-818b-adfe436021fc"}], "dateCreated": "2016-10-26T10:43:18Z", "siteId": 47, "videoStill": "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201610/3484/36517057001_5177392007001_5177381918001-vs.jpg?pubId=36517057001", "contentProtectionState": "metered", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/videos/news/2016/10/26/92479732/", "renditions": [{"contentUrl": "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/roc-mobile/201610/3484/36517057001_5177389360001_5177381918001.mp4", "bitrate": 1801000, "audioOnly": false}, {"contentUrl": "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/roc-mobile/201610/3484/36517057001_5177389521001_5177381918001.mp4", "bitrate": 522000, "audioOnly": false}], "title": "TAXED OFF!

backs of property owners who live in the communities that serve as home to the State University of New York's 24 four-year residential colleges.An investigative series undertaken by USA Today Network journalists across the state and published last month, found that the state's habit of granting property tax exemptions to a few is shifting a considerable burden to those who aren't exempt.",

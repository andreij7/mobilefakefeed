Emanuel Lutchman had another plot: He would kill his wife.The FBI had not planned to arrest Lutchman on Dec. 30, 2015, when it did \u2014 a day before Lutchman intended to wield a machete and attack New Year's Eve patrons at a Rochester bar.But agents learned that Lutchman had told an FBI informant that he wanted to kill his wife \u2014 Lutchman had earlier been convicted of menacing her \u2014 and agents believed they had to intervene for the woman's safety.\"We were getting worried that he was taking serious steps\" to find his wife, FBI Special Agent Joseph Testani said Thursday, after Lutchman was sentenced to 20 years for conspiring to assist the terrorist organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL.", "contentProtectionState": "metered", "assets":

"about": "A tiny local development corporation formed back in 2015 to help get eight vacant houses near a Superfund site in Holley, Orleans County back on the tax rolls is concerned that an edict from the Trump administration that freezes all grants and contracts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, could create additional delays for their effort.At issue are eight houses left vacant since January 2002, when a number of village residents fled an accidental chemical release at the former Diaz Chemical Corp. on Jackson Street. That spill set off a chain reaction that led within two years to the company's bankruptcy and the Diaz facility being named by EPA to the list of the nation's worst toxic waste sites. Holley is located about 25 miles west of Rochester.", "contentProtectionState": "metered", "assets": [{"status": "published", "contentProtectionState": null, "orientation": "vertical", "author": "MAX
